/*Redefine CDAccount from Display 10.1 so that it is a class rather than a structure.  Use the same member variables as in Display 10.1 but make them private.  Include member functions for each of the following:
1.	One to return initial balance
2.	One to return balance at maturity
3.	One to return interest rate
4.	One to return term

Also do the following:
1.	Include a constructor that sets the member variables to any specified values.
2.	Include a default constructor.
3.	Include an input member function  with one formal parameter of type istream
4.	Include an output member function with one formal parameter of type ostream*/
